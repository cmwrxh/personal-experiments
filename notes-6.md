# Experiment / Note 6 – February 06, 2026

Wrapping up the initial batch of notes files.

## What worked well
- Separate .md files are easy to create via web
- Small PRs per file keep things clean
- Markdown tables/checklists/code blocks all render nicely

## Quick summary so far
- 6 notes files created
- Multiple small PRs opened/merged
- Good practice for GitHub flow
