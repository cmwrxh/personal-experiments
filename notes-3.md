# Experiment / Note 3 – 2026-02-06

Quick test: Trying different markdown elements in a separate file.

## What I'm testing today
- Basic headings and lists
- Code block formatting
- Maybe a table or link later

## Observations
- Markdown renders nicely on GitHub preview
- Easy to add bullet points:  
  - Item one  
  - Item two with **bold** text  
  - Item three with *italics*

## Tiny code snippet example
```python
# Hello from notes-3.md
print("Experiment 3 is live!")

### Why this works well
- It's short (10–15 lines) → fast to type/paste
- Uses common Markdown features (headings, lists, bold/italics, code block) → looks like real notes
- Has a date & number → ties into your "personal-experiments" theme
- Feels like a natural log entry → not empty or repetitive

### How to use it in your PR flow
1. On repo main page → **Add file** → **Create new file**
2. Name: `notes-3.md`
3. Paste the content above (or tweak it slightly — change wording, add/remove a bullet)
4. Scroll down → **Commit changes** section:
   - Select **Create a new branch... and start a pull request**
   - Branch name suggestion: something like `add-notes-3` or `experiment-note-3` (GitHub auto-suggests; just accept or tweak)
   - Commit message: `docs: add initial content to notes-3.md`
5. Click **Propose changes** / **Commit changes**
6. On the PR page → give it a title like `Add experiment note 3 as markdown file`
7. Body (optional): `Small standalone note file for variety in experiments.`
8. **Create pull request**

After this one, you can do similar for notes-4.md, notes-5.md etc. (just increment the number and change 1–2 lines so each PR looks different).

If you want a shorter version (even faster):

```markdown
notes-3.md
Created: February 06, 2026

Experiment 3 summary:
- Testing separate md files vs editing README
- Markdown lists work great here
- Plan: use this folder for random snippets later
