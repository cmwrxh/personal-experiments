# Experiment / Note 4 – February 06, 2026

Continuing the pattern: Separate file for quick thoughts and tests.

## Today's focus
- Trying a simple checklist in markdown
- Adding a horizontal rule for separation

## Checklist for future experiments
- [ ] Add more code examples
- [ ] Test linking between notes (e.g. [Note 3](./notes-3.md))
- [ ] Experiment with tables

---

Quick code test:
```javascript
// Experiment 4 snippet
console.log("Note 4 loaded – progress!");
